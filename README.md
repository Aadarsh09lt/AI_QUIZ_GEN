# AI_QUIZ_GEN

# 📘 AI Quiz Generator (PDF → MCQ Generator)

The **AI Quiz Generator** is an NLP-powered application that automatically generates high-quality **multiple-choice questions (MCQs)** from any uploaded PDF.
Built using **Python, Streamlit, NLTK, and PyMuPDF**, this tool extracts meaningful concepts, identifies key nouns, and forms MCQs with distractors — completely offline.

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ **PDF Text Extraction**

* Uses **PyMuPDF (fitz)** to extract clean text from uploaded PDFs.
* Automatically removes unwanted characters, URLs, and noisy content.

### ✅ **Smart Question Generation**

* Generates MCQs based on **noun extraction** and **POS tagging**.
* Ensures:

  * No dates, times, or generic words as answers.
  * Clean, meaningful fill-in-the-blank questions.
  * Intelligent distractors using noun pools.

### ✅ **NLP-Powered Processing**

* NLTK tokenizers (sent_tokenize, word_tokenize)
* POS tagging using `averaged_perceptron_tagger_eng`
* Custom blacklist filtering to avoid meaningless MCQs.

### ✅ **Interactive Streamlit UI**

* Upload PDF → Select number of questions → Get MCQs instantly.
* Clean UI with quiz cards, score display, and reset option.

### ✅ **Results & Evaluation**

* Shows:

  * Correct answers
  * User's selected answers
  * Final score with highlights
